# friendfinder

Purpose: In this assignment, the user would answer a series of survey questions in order to find their celeb match. After the user hits 'submit,' the ideal celeb match for that user will appear as a pop up.

Challenges: Although I was able to built out my application, I was unable to get the applicable celeb match to appear. I was having difficulty building out the function that would find the least total difference between a user's inputs, and my pre-built friends (celeb) array (refer to friends.js). Additionally, I could not get the modal pop up to appear once the user hit submit.I was even confused in certain areas. For instance, I wasn't sure if my function for find total difference between a user's inputs, and my friends app should be embedded in my apiRoutes.js or servey.html file (as javascript) text at the very end.This confusion arose because I was not sure how the app would take in and compare the user's input with the friends object array.

Next Steps: Ensuring that the modal pop up occurs once the user hits submit, and making sure that the applicable function for finding the least total difference and comparing the user with the friends array works.
